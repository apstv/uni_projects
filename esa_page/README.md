ESA page is a project I made during course 'Mobile GIS'. Website consists of main page and 4 subpages. On the main page you can find list of selected episodes from ESA's YouTube channel (programme 'Earth from Space'). Every photo and description are links to the subpages, where you can find more info about particular episode. 

Official ESA website is available here:
