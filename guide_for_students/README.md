This guide is a project I made during course 'Mobile GIS'. Originally everything is written in Polish, but translation is in progress.
Guide is made for students, who start their studies at Institute of Geography and Regional Development (Wroc≈Çaw University). 
Website is made using Leaflet library. Map shows all of the institute's buildings and some additional locations (e.g. restaurants or groceries).

There's still some things to fix/improve, like location button (it's not showing position radius, but the main function does).
